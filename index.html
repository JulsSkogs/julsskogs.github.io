      <h2>Hello</h2>
      <p class="intro">I am looking to enrich my career with some programming skills! Eventually I would like to pivot into web/app development and project management. After this, I plan on pursuing a ScrumMaster certification before possibly
        returning to the development world to learn to code for Android.</p>
      <p class="intro"> I live in Indianapolis, and have two wonderful Aussie Shephard-mix dogs named Hank and Charlie!</p>

        <h3>Sports</h3>
        <p>I've been involved in sports my whole life, having played baseball and basketball for a season each as a kid, spending two years racing karts and playing soccer for 10 years throughout. I've also coached two years of highschool soccer! On
          top of my own personal involvement in sports, I'm a big sports fan as well. I'm a fan of the Bears, Cubs, Blackhawks, Manchester United and the Ferrai Formula 1 team. No, I don't know why I subject myself to such a horrid fandom. I also
          follow IndyCar pretty closely, and while I don't have a favorite team or driver anymore, I still enjoy taking in the spectacle.</p>

        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>I grew up in a very musical household and still carry a passion for it to this day! I love basically all things pop punk and easycore, with some of my favorite bands being Belmont, Fall Out Boy, Neck Deep, U2, Foo Fighters, A Day to
          Remember, Rodeo Ruby Love, awolnation, Twenty One Pilots, The 1975 and Jimmy Buffet. At some point I would like to start a music podcast to discuss pop punk, etc. hopefully starting with a breakdown of <a class="body-hyperlinks"

        <h3>Weightlifting</h3>
        <p>Prior to falling off the wagon last fall (no pun intended), I had acheived 3 of my first 4 weightlifting goals by hitting 135/225/405 on OHP/bench/deadlift. I would like get back into the gym and get my numbers back to that, as well as
          finally getting my squat to 315.</p>

        <h3>Cooking</h3>
        <p>I have been off-and-on with meal prepping for a few years, but lately I have developed a real taste for home cooking! I've made my own kombucha and vinegars, and would like to start trying to make beer. I've also gotten much better at
          cooking in general, which is always nice! It seems like just about every day at this point I run across a new recipe or technique video that I want to try out, and it's tons of fun.</p>

        <h3>Gardening</h3>
        <p>This year, my girlfriend and I decided to plant an herb and fruit/vegetable garden in our back yard! We planted brussel sprouts, broccoli (which unfortunately didn't make it), bell peppers, lettuce, three types of tomato, onions, artichoke
          and banana peppers. Our fruits
          are strawberries, raspberries, blue berries and rhubarb (though I suppose that's a veggie) and for herbs we went with mint, lavendar, rosemary, cilantro and dill.</p>

        <h3>Coding</h3>
        <p>At the risk of stating the obvious, I figured I should include this. This has been one of the more fun learning experiences that I can remember. It's really a wonder to watch your work add up and develop right in front of you with every
          line of code and shift and change. It's like virtual LEGOs, which are <em>another</em> thing I enjoy! I've made my way through the HTML and CSS modules of Angela Yu's Complete Web Development Bootcamp from Udemy (through which I built this
          very website!). I'm hoping to get through the Bootstrap module just as swiftly as I am super excited to see what comes next! I have also set up my own media PC/Plex server that lives on a Synology DS420+, having setup most of the programs I
          use through Docker containers. While frustrating at times, that was another very fun learning experience that was well worth it in the end.</p>

        <h3>Gaming</h3>
        <p>What?! A dude in his 20's who is into playing video games? Can't believe it, it's absolutely unheard of. But alas, here we are. I have sunk countless hours into the Football Manager series, and get lost in Europa Universalis saves a few
          times a year which has in turn furthered my interest in European history from the Renaissance to the early 1800s. Some of my other favorite games are the Assassin's Creed series (Ezio's trilogy in particular) and the Kingdom Hearts series
          as well as a bunch of different sports games over the year. Oh what I would give for Madden and FIFA
          to actually be good again. I built my first gaming PC in February of 2020, just in time to avoid the chip shortage after having grown up as a console gamer.</p>
