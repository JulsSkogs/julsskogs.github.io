        <h3>Sports</h3>
        <p>I've been involved in sports my whole life, having played baseball and basketball for a season each as a kid, spending two years racing karts and playing soccer for 10 years throughout. I've also coached two years of highschool soccer! On top of my own personal involvement in sports, I'm a big sports fan as well. I'm a fan of the Bears, Cubs, Blackhawks, Manchester United and the Ferrai Formula 1 team. No, I don't know why I subject myself to such a horrid fandom. I also follow IndyCar pretty closely, and while I don't have a favorite team or driver anymore, I still enjoy taking in the spectacle.</p>

        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>I grew up in a very musical household and still carry a passion for it to this day! I love basically all things pop punk and easycore, with some of my favorite bands being Belmont, Fall Out Boy, Neck Deep, U2, Foo Fighters, A Day to
          Remember, Rodeo Ruby Love, awolnation, Twenty One Pilots, The 1975 and Jimmy Buffet. At some point I would like to start a music podcast to discuss pop punk, etc. hopefully starting with a breakdown of <a class="body-hyperlinks" href="https://www.kerrang.com/the-51-greatest-pop-punk-albums-green-day-wonder-years-blink-2017">Kerrang!'s 2017 list of the 51 Greatest Pop Punk Albums Ever.</a> I also have a growing record collection that you can find <a

        <h3>Weightlifting</h3>
        <p>I have had a turbulent relationship with the gym over the past couple years, and unfortunately I found myself with a couple of injuries to my hip and shoulder blade after having an otherwise very successful 2021. That unfortunately led to a dramatic decrease in motiviation for lifting, but I am looking forward to getting back to it and bettering myself physically.</p>

        <h3>Cooking</h3>
        <p>I have been off-and-on with meal prepping for a few years, but lately I have developed a real taste for home cooking! I've made my own kombucha and vinegars, and would like to start trying to make beer. I've also gotten much better at cooking in general, which is always nice! It seems like just about every day at this point I run across a new recipe or technique video that I want to try out, and it's tons of fun.</p>

        <h3>Gardening</h3>
        <p>In 2022, my fiancee and I decided to plant an herb and fruit/vegetable garden in our back yard! We planted brussel sprouts, broccoli (which unfortunately didn't make it), bell peppers, lettuce, three types of tomato, onions, artichoke and banana peppers. Our fruits are strawberries, raspberries, blue berries and rhubarb (though I suppose that's a veggie) and for herbs we went with mint, lavendar, rosemary, cilantro and dill.</p>

        <h3>Coding</h3>
        <p>I am currently engaging in self-paced online courses to help me learn to code! I am hoping to, in the future, move into web development as a career in the not too distant future. The learning journey has been super fun, sort of like adult LEGO, and the challenges have been surprisingly enjoyable to overcome. I have also set up my own media PC/Plex server that lives on a Synology DS420+, having setup most of the programs I use through Docker containers. While frustrating at times, that was another very fun learning experience that was well worth it in the end.</p>

        <h3>Gaming</h3>
        <p>What?! A dude in his 20's who is into playing video games? Can't believe it, it's absolutely unheard of. But alas, here we are. I have sunk countless hours into the Football Manager series, and get lost in Europa Universalis saves a few times a year which has in turn furthered my interest in European history from the Renaissance to the early 1800s. Some of my other favorite games are the Assassin's Creed series (Ezio's trilogy in particular) and the Kingdom Hearts series as well as a bunch of different sports games over the year. Oh what I would give for Madden and FIFA to actually be good again. I built my first gaming PC in February of 2020, just in time to avoid the chip shortage after having grown up as a console gamer.</p>
